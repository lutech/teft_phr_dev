The segments in a| URL normally follow this pattern:||	example.com/class/method/id/|| In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship| so that a different class/function is called than the one| corresponding to the URL.|| Please see the user guide for complete details:||	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html|| -------------------------------------------------------------------------| RESERVED ROUTES| -------------------------------------------------------------------------|| There area two reserved routes:||	$route['default_controller'] = 'welcome';|| This route indicates which controller class should be loaded if the| URI contains no data. In the above example, the "welcome" class| would be loaded.||	$route['404_override'] = 'errors/page_missing';|| This route will tell the Router what URI segments to use if those provided| in the URL cannot be matched to a valid route.|*/$route['default_controller'] = "home";$route['home'] = "site";$route['404_override'] = '';/*Quality Assurance*/$route['ltss/qualityassurance/(.*)'] = "ltss/$1";$route['ltss/qualityassurance/cahpssurvey/details'] = "ltss/cahpssurveydetails";$route['ltss/programforms/careassessment/details'] = "ltss/careassessmentdetails";$route['ltss/programforms/pss/details'] = "ltss/pssdetails";$route['emergency/reportableevents/details'] = "emergency/reportableeventdetails";/*Sandbox*/$route['sandbox/billing/serviceactivities'] = "sandbox/serviceactivities";$route['sandbox/billing/serviceclaims'] = "sandbox/serviceclaims";$route['sandbox/billing/servicebudget'] = "sandbox/servicebudget";/* End of file routes.php *//* Location: ./application/config/routes.php */
