                    Adult Protective Services (APS) Unit within the Division of Aging and Adult Services was created through legislation passed in 2006. APS investigates
                    reports of suspected abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults. Guided by the Mississippi Vulnerable Persons Act, APS provides for the protection
                    of at-risk vulnerable individuals, age 18 and older, residing in private home settings, through direct delivery or referral to resources within the community.
                    The APS program was expanded to 24 staff dedicated to protecting vulnerable adults by investigating suspected and reported claims of abuse, neglect and
                    exploitation in local communities and homes.
